one program one algorithm every day, on different language. remember how complex python on openstack

I am fourty now, I don't think that I can archieve other great things now. If there has any, It maybe in software, in opensource field.

But, experience so many opensource projects, I think my base is too low.

I have no choice, to let the dream come true, the dream when I get older, still I had some valuable business to do, that is opensource,
so, I have to make efforts on it.

To be an opensource contributer, no doublt, I need prompt my programmer skill, In fact, I have some talent in programming.

In a summary, I will try my best to improve my programming skill, and architecture skill.
It's a long way, hard way, but I have to face it.
